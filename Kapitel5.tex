An unprocessed image is shown to the user. The user marks areas with spots, where he thinks that it is signal or dark spots he wants to have detected. Then the program sets the parameters in a way that at the user labeled areas will contain signal in the end.

Alternatively one could set the parameters and get a direct feedback which points would be selected in the shown frame.
