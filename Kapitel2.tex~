\section{the data}
The datasets for STORM microscopy that we recieve from our collaborators from
Bioquant are big datasets of several gigabyte in the Andor .sif format. Each
file conains a stack of pictures, normaly between 1000 and 10000, taken
consecutively.
In each picture there are beads and signals. Both result from very small 
fluorescent molecules attached to the structures that are investigated. The
light of this pointlike objects is dissorted to a gaussian shaped signal due to
the large magnification.
Beads are molecules that emit light at any time contrary to the other signal
which blinks that means it is visible in just one frame at an explicit location.
The beads are used as landmarks for later alignment of two or more different
color channels. The other spots are the structure that the biologist are
interested in. Each of the gaussian shaped signals should be recognized and the
center will be determined with subpixel accuracy and is stored in the end in a
list to be further processed by the colorcomposer application.



\section{Transformations}
\subsection{Transform to real intensities}
The images aquired from the camera show not the real intensities
$I_\text{true}$, which result from the photon emission of the probe, but
transformed ones $I_\text{meas}$. There are two main reasons why the taken image
differs from the true image, besides noise.\\
There is dark current which means that even a picture taken with closed shutter
would get some intensity, even without any light hitting the sensor chip of the
camera. This is a result of thermal movement of the atoms off the sensor chip
and can be reduced by cooling. The dark current noise adds an almost constant
value $o$ to the output signal.
Incoming photons create electrons via inner photoelectric effect. This electrons
are collected for each pixel and might be amplified to get the final result.
Assuming a linear relation between the number of incoming photons and the number
of electrons created and a linear amplifier results in a factor $g$. This factor
is multiplied with the number of photons captured during exposure time for each
pixel.\\
If the gain factor $g$ and the offset $o$ are known the true intensity, the
number of photons detected is:
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{true} = \dfrac{I_\text{meas}-o}{g}.
\end{equation}
How to estimate this two parameters will be covered in the next section.

\section{Estimate gain factor and offset}
\subsection{Skellam distribution}
The method described by \cite{skellam} is used to estimate the
gain factor. For this methode a Skellam distribution is used. The probability
mass function of a Skellam distribution is a function of the difference between
two Poisson random variables
\begin{equation}
	p(k;\mu_1, \mu_2) =
	\exp(-(\mu_1+\mu_2))\left(\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}\right)^{k/2}~I_{|k|}\left(2\sqrt{\mu_1
	\mu_2}\right)
\end{equation}  
where $n_1$, $n_2$ are the Poisson random variables and $k = n_1 - n_2$.
$I_{|k|}$ means the modified Bessel function of the first kind.\\
Mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$ of the Skellam distribution are given by
\begin{align}
	&&\mu &= \mu_1 - \mu_2,& \sigma^2 &= \mu_1 + \mu_2\\
	\Rightarrow &&\mu_1& = \frac{\mu + \sigma^2}{2},& \mu_2 &=\frac{-\mu +
	\sigma^2}{2}
\end{align} 
Each dataset is three-dimensional where time is the third
dimension. Therefore mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ can be calculated from
the data for each pixel individually
\begin{align}
	\mu(i,j) & = \frac{\Sigma_t(I_t(i,j)-I_{t+1}(i,j))}{n}\\
	\sigma^2 & = \frac{\Sigma_t(\mu-(I_t(i,j)-I_{t+1}(i,j)))^2}{n-1}
\end{align} 
To determine the gain factor the Skellam parameter are plotted over the mean
intensities. A straight line can be fitted and its slope is exactly the gain
factor. 
\subsection{fitting the line}
For the real data it is not so easy to fit the line. All points would lay on a
straight line if they would have the same intensity for the whole time. In
principle this is not the case. One key aspect of the strom methode is that the
flourescent moleculse are blinking. This causes an increase in the Skellam
parameter, which is more or less the variance of the intensities of each pixel.
The blinking causes the points to tend to be above the ideal line.
The condition that the pixels should have constant intensitie over the whole
time series holds for background pixel that are never on and for beads. Taking
this into acount the line is not fitted to all pixels. The intensities of all
pixels are sorted. After that the range of intensities is divided into a
certain number of intervals, typically about 20. In each interval it is
searched for the lowes Skellam parameter. Even this points contain usually many
outliers. Within this points it is searched for a good line. Therefore a random
number of points between 5 and the maximal number of points is  selected
randomly. Then the best fit according to the minimum of total least squares is
calculated from this points. This is done several times to get the best line
ignoring outliers.\\
Ideally the zero crossing on the intensity axis, which means the intensity with
zero Skellam parameter. This intensity is the contribution of the dark current
$o$.
In practice it is much more stable to take the overall minimum pixel intensity
as offset.\\
The result is a global value for the gain and the offset. 

\subsection{Approach using skewness of poisson distribution}
For every pixel there is a set of multiple values in the set. This allows to
calculate the different parameters individually for each pixel. One can
calculate mean and variance of the measured intensities $I_\text{meas}(i,j)$ and
gets
\begin{align}
	\text{mean}(I_\text{meas}(i,j))& = \text{mean}(I_\text{true}(i,j)) + o\\
	\text{var}(I_\text{meas}(i,j))& = g\cdot\text{var}(I_\text{true}(i,j))\\
\end{align}
Assuming a Poisson distribution as the true intensity, mean and variance would
be the same. Unfortunately the mean true intensities are unknown and it is
not possible to determin $g$ and $o$ so far. For large mean Intensities $\mu$
the Poisson distribution becomes more and more similar to a Gauss distribution
with the same mean. However, for small means, the Poisson distribution is not
symmetric. The skewness $s_p$ of a Poission distribution is the inverse of the
square root of the mean $(\mu)^{-.5}$. It can also be directly
calculated from data
\begin{equation}
	s_p = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \left(\frac{x_i - \bar x}{\sigma}\right)^3
\end{equation}
The skewness is invariant to shift and multiplication with a constant. This
means that the transformation caused by the camera gain and the dark current
does not affect the skewness. This gives a third equation to solve for $g$ and
$o$.\\
This approach has very strict limitation to at least for background not to
intense signals. If the mean of the true Poisson distributin is higher than
roughly 30 the skewness gives due to noise no stabel results and it is
impossible to determin the mean intensity in this way.

\section{Mask for noise supression}
\section{Calibration measurement and plausibility}

\subsection{Poisson distribution}
One very important probability distribution in physics is the Poisson
distribution. It describes the results of ``counting experiments'' and is
therefore very important for image processing as the pictures taken with a
camera are in principle counts of photons reaching the camera. Photon counting
noise is one important example.\\
Poisson distributions are just defined for integer values and the variance is
the same as the mean value of the distribution. Another important attribute is
the skewnes which is the inverse of the squarerot of the mean or variance.\\ 
The probability mass function is:
\begin{equation}
	p(n,\mu) = \frac{\mu^n}{n!}\exp(-\mu)
\end{equation}


\subsection{Anscombe transform}
The Anscombe transform is used to transform a random variable with a Poisson
distribution into one with an approximatly constant standard deviation. The
transformation is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	A(x) = 2\sqrt{x+\frac{3}{8}}.
\end{equation}
As one can see in figure \ref{anscombe} the Anscombe transformations result has
for mean intensities greater than 4 a intensity independent standard deviation of
one.

	distributions}

\section{Accuracy of detection}
Unfortunately the position of the flourescent molecules can't be detected
perfectly. There are three main contribution to the error in detection.\\
First, there is the problem of finding the maximum in a noisy signal. Due to
noise the pixel next to the true maximum might get some intensity and be
therefore brighter.\\
Second, the choice of the gain factor and the offset might influence the
precision.\\
Third, the position is deteted by upscaling the pixel grid and interpolation.
After that the maximums position of the upscaled grid is taken as the resulting
position. This gives an error from roughly pixelwidth divided by square root of
two.
\subsection{error from noise}
Because there is no ground truth availible for micoscropy data, data must be
generated. This was done similar as described by \cite{simulated}.
