Microscopy is an important tool for cell biology. Super resolution microscopy yields deeper insights into cells, further than Abbe's resolution limit. This is achieved by taking many pictures with fewer and therefore easier seperable fluorescent markers within each picture.\newline
SimpleSTORM is an efficient algorithm which was originally developed by \cite{MAJoachim}. The imporovements of the general performance and usability will be described in this thesis.\newline
Using selfcalibration it is no longer necessary to provide any parameter like the camera gain, camera offset or the expected signals point spread functions width. All cucial parameters are determined automatically but can also be manually adjusted. 
A model for the background was used with which inhomogenous backgrounds can be corrected, it was also possible to determine the quality of the signals found.\newline

The improved Colorcomposer software provides easy auto alignment of different color-channels and measurments of colocalisation, which is an important measure for investigation of molecular interactions.
