Microscopy is an important tool in cell biology. Super resolution microscopy yields deeper insights into cells, further than Abbe's resolution limit. This is achieved by taking many pictures with few and therefore easy seperable fluorescent markers within each picture.\newline
SimpleSTORM is an efficient algorithm which was originally developed by \cite{MAJoachim}. The imporovements of the general performance and usability will be described in this thesis.\newline
Using selfcalibration it is no longer necessary to provide any parameter such as camera gain, camera offset or the expected signals point spread functions width. All crucial parameters are determined automatically but can also be manually adjusted. 
A model for the background is used to correct for inhomogenous backgrounds, and to determine the quality of the signals found.\newline

A second component of the SimpleSTORM software is the Colorcomposer. It provides easy auto alignment of different color-channels and measurments of colocalisation, which is an important measure to investigate molecular interactions.
